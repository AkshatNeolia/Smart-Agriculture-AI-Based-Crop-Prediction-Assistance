# Smart-Agriculture-AI-Based-Crop-Prediction-Assistance

# AI-Powered Agricultural Insights & Price Prediction Platform ðŸŒ¾  

## Overview  
This project aims to build a **one-stop solution** for Indian farmers by leveraging **AI and Machine Learning** to provide insights on crop prices, recommendations, weather-based alerts, and more. The platform will be a **simple, user-friendly website** where farmers can access critical agricultural data to make informed decisions.  

## Features (Planned)  
âœ… **Crop Price Prediction** â€“ AI-driven forecasting of crop prices based on historical data and market trends.  
âœ… **Crop Recommendation** â€“ Suggests the best crop based on soil type, location, and climate conditions.  
âœ… **Weather Insights** â€“ Provides real-time weather updates tailored to farming needs.  
âœ… **Weather-Based Farming Alerts** â€“ Notifies farmers about extreme weather conditions affecting crops.  
âœ… **Seasonal Crop Calendar** â€“ Guides farmers on the best times for sowing, fertilization, and harvesting.  
âœ… **Multilingual Support** â€“ Accessible in multiple Indian languages for better reach.  
âœ… **Offline Accessibility (SMS/IVR)** â€“ Allows farmers to receive alerts and insights via SMS or voice messages.  

## Tech Stack (Planned)  
ðŸ–¥ **Frontend** â€“ React.js (for a clean and interactive UI)  
âš¡ **Backend** â€“ FastAPI (for handling API requests efficiently)  
ðŸ¤– **Machine Learning** â€“ Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (for model development)  
ðŸ“¦ **Database** â€“ Firebase / Firestore (for easy integration and scalability)  
ðŸŒ¦ **APIs & External Services** â€“ OpenWeatherMap (weather data), Getform (form handling), Free SMS APIs (for notifications)

## Development Status ðŸš§  
ðŸš€ *Phase 1: Research & Data Collection* â€“ Identifying and gathering datasets for training ML models.  
ðŸ”¬ *Phase 2: Model Development* â€“ Experimenting with different ML models to select the best one.  
ðŸ›  *Phase 3: Web Development* â€“ Building and integrating the website with backend services.  
ðŸ“¢ *Phase 4: Deployment & Testing* â€“ Hosting the platform and testing usability.  

## Future Enhancements ðŸŒ±  
ðŸ”¹ AI-driven pest and disease alerts  
ðŸ”¹ Integration with government schemes for farmer benefits  
ðŸ”¹ Community forum for farmers to share insights
